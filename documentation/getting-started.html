                  Vue
                  is a theme based on <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap 3</a>.
                  and inspired by Google's  <a href= "http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design</a>
               </p>
               <p>
                  Vue tightly integrates with Material Design to bring your app's landing page a look and feel that is far ahead of the current web design standards. Material Design is the next big trend in web design and Vue is the first to bring you it.

               <p>
                  Since Vue is built on top of Bootstrap as a theme, you can use it in your <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 3</a> project.
                  We did not modify any line of Bootstrap, so you will be safe using Vue in your ongoing project.

                  To edit the look and feel of Vue, all you need to do is edit the CSS sources.
                  <br/>
                  1. All the major CSS styles are housed in the <code>style.css</code> stylesheet, located in -
                  <code>"static/css/style.css"</code>. For most changes this is where you'll need to go in order to make changes.
               </p>
               <p>
                  2. The easiest way to start working with Vue on your site is to simply take the main <code>index.html</code> and edit it to suit your needs.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>documentation/</strong> As you can see this directory contains all documentation for Vue. In this directory the two main files that you should open are <code>getting-started.html</code> (Which is this page) and <code>components.html</code>. These two pages will take you through all the documentation that you need to know about Vue. 
                  <br>
                  <em class="text-info">Take note to pay special attention to <code>components.html</code>, which gives you a breakdown of all the individual components that make up Vue. <br/></em>.
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>resources/</strong> The resources directory contains all external resources that are not used by the website. Within the resources directory you will find all mockups and resources which you can use to further edit your site. 
                  <br><br><em class="text-info">Take special note of the <code>mockups/</code> folder which contains all the 20+ Smartphone .PSD Mockups which you can use to display your App within on your website. </em><br><br>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>static/</strong> This directory contains all the static resources needed to load <code>index.html</code>. All resources that are currently used by the website can be located in sub-directories of this directory. <br><br><em class="text-info">Be careful not to delete any files from here unless you are absolutely sure as this could result in your website not displaying/loading correctly.<br/></em>.
